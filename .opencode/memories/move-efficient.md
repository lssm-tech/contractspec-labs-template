“Do Small Things Now. Track Big Things Systemically.”
"If a task, decision, or fix is self-contained and low-risk, execute it immediately. If it exceeds the local scope or may impact other systems, log it clearly with context and defer it into the system's prioritization loop."

Principles:

- Local Optimization: Minimize friction for small, modular actions that do not introduce debt or violate cursor rules.
- Systemic Capture: Larger tasks must be tracked with full context (origin, dependencies, affected modules/domains).
- Bias for Flow: Avoid context-switching or overplanning when the solution is safe, simple, and reversible.
- Conscious Deferral: Never postpone without capturing why and where to revisit — defer with traceability.
- Logging: Record deferred items in the team backlog with owner, due date, and context; note blocking dependencies.

Heuristics:
✅ Can it be done in under 10 minutes without side effects? → Do it now.
✅ Does it involve multiple domains, people, or potential debt? → Track it clearly in the backlog.
✅ Is the deferred item visible in the right backlog/system? → If not, it’s as good as lost.
✅ Did you note enough context for someone else (or AI) to pick it up later? → Make your future self grateful.
✅ Side effects = user-visible changes, schema/data mutations, billing, or irreversible migrations; if any apply, slow down and log.
