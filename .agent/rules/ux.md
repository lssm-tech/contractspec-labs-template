Intentful Feedback and Ceremonial Flow
"All user interactions must express intent clearly, provide meaningful feedback, and contribute to a coherent experiential flow. Ceremonial moments (onboarding, transitions, thresholds) should encode narrative and social meaning, not ornamental fluff."

Principles:
Intent-first Design: Every action should be discoverable, understandable, and undoable. Design anticipates user intent and reacts accordingly.

Feedback Loops: Immediate and visible feedback for every gesture — tap, swipe, submit, wait. Micro-interactions guide the user through state changes.

Temporal Semantics: Use transition timing, delay, or rhythm to signal the weight of an action (e.g., farewell rituals vs. checkbox taps).

Ceremonial Design: Identify and ritualize transitions (arrival, departure, role shift, goal achieved) using ambient, narrative, or symbolic cues.

Cognitive Friction: Minimize effort required to complete goals, but preserve meaningful pauses where intention matters (e.g., irreversible decisions).

Heuristics:
✅ Does every action give visible or ambient feedback?
✅ Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end to flows?
✅ Are important transitions marked with ritual or ceremony?
✅ Can the interface teach itself by showing, not telling?
✅ Accessibility: ARIA roles/labels, keyboard/focus order, prefers-reduced-motion supported, contrast upheld.
✅ Mobile-friendly spacing/tap targets; feedback within 200ms, completion paths as short as possible.
✅ Undo/confirm patterns for destructive or irreversible actions; show progress for long-running tasks.
✅ Key feedback and transitions emit analytics events with success/error/latency metadata.
