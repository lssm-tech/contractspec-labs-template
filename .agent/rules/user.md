Low-Tech Friendly User Experience
"The platform is designed for who are experts in their craft, not in technology. Every interaction, feature, and flow must be accessible, self-explanatory, and forgiving for users with minimal digital experience."

Principles:

- Radical Simplicity: Prioritize clarity and ease-of-use over advanced features or customization. Avoid jargon and technical complexity.
- Mobile-First: Assume users are on their phones, often on-site or in the field. All interfaces must be optimized for small screens, touch, and quick access.
- Guidance by Design: Use clear labels, icons, and step-by-step flows. Provide visible feedback and error prevention at every step.
- Forgiving Interactions: Make actions undoable, prevent accidental loss, and offer help or hints proactively.
- Minimal Cognitive Load: Reduce the number of steps, choices, and required inputs. Default to sensible values and automate where possible.

Heuristics:
✅ Can a non-technical artisan complete the task without external help?
✅ Is every action discoverable and clearly labeled?
✅ Does the interface work seamlessly on mobile devices?
✅ Are errors, confirmations, and next steps always visible and understandable?
✅ Is the experience as simple as possible, but no simpler?
✅ Copy avoids jargon; uses task-language and short sentences (≤8th grade).
✅ Tap targets meet mobile guidance; key flows respond in <200ms UI feedback, <2s completion where possible.
✅ Form errors are specific and placed inline with the field; provide corrective hints.
